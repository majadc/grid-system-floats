# The Grid System based on floats

This project shows the mechanics of creating a grid system using the CSS float property, supplemented by the 'clearfix hack.' While the float property was traditionally used for constructing web layouts before the advent of the flex and grid CSS layout modules, it was not originally designed for this purpose. Despite its common use, relying on the float property for organizing layout elements often resulted in undesirable behaviors, most notably the collapse of the parent container containing 'floating' children. To address this issue, the 'clearfix hack' was implemented as a solution.

To construct a grid with defined columns and widths, specify the desired number of columns and their respective widths. Input the number of columns by counting the items between commas, where each number denotes the elements per column.
The numbers must be integers from 1 to 12 and their sum must be 12.
